# expo-native-firebase

A detached Expo v24 project with react-native-firebase added. 

> This is not a npm package

**This is the prophecy PR: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/11573**

Once it lands, __Blob support__ will be a part of React Native and Expo. 
At that point you can upload files to Firebase Storage... 
Until then, here is a [detached ExpoKit](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/detach.html#content) project with [Firebase integration](https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v3.2.x/getting-started) for both Android and iOS.

The two dopest frameworks for native app development combined!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ’™

The API for react-native-firebase is very similar if not exactly the same as the web implementation. 
Eventually when Blob support is added, you should be able to move your code back into a full Expo app pretty painlessly! ðŸ˜‡


### Notice

The following will not be available even with Blob Support:
* Analytics [(Because of Google Analytics)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-analytics)
* Phone Auth
* Crash Reporting
* Crashlytics
* Dynamic Links
* Invites
* Remote Config
* Performance Monitoring


> Expo FileSystem prevents external libs from reading local files, so use CameraRoll to retrieve photos!
